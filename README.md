# AllLenguageProject
Easy project to let people speack with each other also without knowing same lenguage. I say easy because we won't use API for any part of the process.

## Scope

Allow people to comunicate without lenguage barrears.
<br>

## Libraries

For translator:
```bash
pip install translate
```
For speeach recognition: 
to capture audio from the microphone and recognize speec. !!!Attebtion!!! need python version compatible with pyAudio
```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
```
For audio speach at lowd:
```bash
pip install pyttsx3
```
<br>

## Steps

1. select lenguage speaker 1 and 2
2. speach - to - text: speaker 1 say something
3. translate text: speaker 1 phrase is translated in speaker 2 lenguage
4. text - to - speech: speak at loud the translated text in speaker 2 lenguage
5. repeat the procecess... like in a dialogue, before speaker 1 then speaker 2
6. create GUI, web site, app
<br>

## Code explenation
Translator.py: code that translate user input text from lenguage 1 to lenguage 2 and viceversa
<br>

## Evaluetion

<br>
Without using API the project result to easy and uncopleate. But still the problem is fixed and we allow people of diffrent lenguages to speack togheter with no barrear.
